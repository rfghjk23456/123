dographs.

Sensors (receptors) are acyclic subgraphs whose elements are not reachable from any resonator.

Dispensers (effectors) are acyclic subgraphs whose
elements are not reachable from any resonator.

Transmitters are acyclic subgraphs whose elements
are reachable from at least one resonator and from
whose elements at least one other (different) resonator
is reachable.

Transmitters and transmitters are consumers.

Sensors and transmitters are suppliers.

We can also consider generating resonators (not reachable from other resonators) and consuming resonators
(reachable from other resonators).

Among resonators, we can distinguish unimodal (harmonic) resonators and multimodal (non-harmonic) resonators (multimodal waveform). All multimodal resonators are consuming resonators. Each mode is phase
shifted by less than a period.

A resonator-free subgraph can be extracted from any
structure, which is the set of all vertices and edges
reachable from the receptor elements.

The remaining edges together with their initial and
final vertices form the resonator subpseudograph.

A receptor element is called a sensor element if it has
no supplier.

A dispenser element is called a dispenser element if
it has no consumer.

If there are no suppliers (sensors or transmitters)
whose elements are suppliers to the generating resonator,
then all its elements are sensor elements.

If there are no consumers (dispensers or transmitters)
whose elements are consumers of the resonator, then all
its elements are dispenser elements.

The method for determining the capacitive characteristics of structures used in problem solving is summarized
in the following principles.

Each resonator has a period, which is the partial GCD
T of its own period and periods of all (its) suppliers,
from which it consumes, to the GCD of this GCD (T)
and all its divisors k, for which the convolution of the
phases k ∗ n with the phases (taking into account their
shifts) of all modes (waveforms) of the signal is equal to
k T − k ∗ ((T − k)!).

For each consumer (dispenser or transmitter) element,
the period is calculated similarly, except that instead
of the GCD of the period itself and the periods of all
(its) suppliers from which it consumes, the GCD of the
periods of all its suppliers is taken.

For each supplier element, the potential period, which
is the period of the consumer in the inverted pseudograph (inverse ratio pseudo-graph), can be similarly
determined.

For each sensor element (supplier), a period can be
calculated that is equal to the LCM of the periods of all
its consumers (taking into account the phase shift).
The entropy of a set of resonators is calculated on a
period equal to the GCD of periods of all resonators of
this set.

If resonators are present, then the (maximum possible)
entropy of the entire pseudograph is valid and can be
computed as the greatest entropy of the greatest entropy
of the greatest entropies of the smallest sets of resonators
cutting the set (paths) of the set of smallest sets of paths
connecting all sensor elements to all dispenser elements.

If all sensor elements and dispenser elements are
resonator elements, then the (minimum required) entropy
of the entire pseudograph is valid and can be computed
as the smallest entropy of the smallest entropies of the
smallest sets of resonators cutting the set (paths) of
the set of smallest sets of paths connecting all sensor
elements to all dispenser elements.

If all sensor elements and dispenser elements are
not resonator elements, then the (minimum necessary)
entropy of the whole pseudograph is invalid (imaginary)
and is computed on the period equal to the LCM of
all periods (elements) of the subpseudographs of the
pseudograph and the maximum of the lengths of the
(simple) paths from the sensor element to the dispenser
element.

The entropy of an unbound pseudograph can be calculated as the average (minimum, maximum, etc.) of the
entropies of its components on a period equal to the LCM
of periods (on which calculations for) its components
were performed.

\textbf{Conclusions}
\end{center}
The classification of enumerable finite structures and
their representations is proposed, relations between
classes of this classification are considered. The classification is oriented on unification of knowledge representation with finite structure and algorithmization of
solutions of problems of investigation of topological
and metric properties of structures of meaning space in
order to exclude redundant fragments of knowledge at
representation in meaning space.

General quantitative evaluations of mappings of finite
structures with accuracy up to order preservation to
ordinal and metric scales in the study of corresponding
properties of these structures are given. An approach to
the classification of quantitative features of finite structures is proposed. An algorithm for metric computation
on the union of extensional closures of sense space
concepts is proposed.

A model and a method for computing entropy (as
one of the invariants) for finite dynamic structures of
information processing models (in accordance with the
models of graph dynamical system and generalized finite
automaton [64]) based on analytical calculation of transition probabilities on the state graph in accordance with
its structure are proposed.
The features of structures of semantic space that can
be used as invariants in order to reduce the time to
identify redundant fragments in the semantic space are
considered.

A model of operational-information space is proposed,
which corresponds to the model of model-parametric
space [67], is oriented to solving the problems of
knowledge management [15], [50], [56] in information
processing and the study of the relationship between
the attributes of structures with operational semantics
expressed by the operational semantics of small and large
step.

An approach to the consideration of infinite structures
through (limit) sequences of finite structures converging
to them is proposed in accordance with the classification
of finite structures, the model of knowledge specification
[5], the algebraic system of extensible sets and the
metamodel of semantic space [56].
